/**
 * The <code>LicensePlateLocationRemote</code> class provides a Java RMI-compliant 
 * interface to MATLAB functions. The interface is compiled from the following files:
 * <pre>
 *  license_plate_location.m
 *  plate_location_kelnel.m
 *  minboundrect.m
 *  rgb2hsi.m
 *  rectify.m
 *  detection_color.m
 * </pre>
 * The {@link #dispose} method <b>must</b> be called on a 
 * <code>LicensePlateLocationRemote</code> instance when it is no longer needed to ensure 
 * that native resources allocated by this class are properly freed, and the server-side 
 * proxy is unexported.  (Failure to call dispose may result in server-side threads not 
 * being properly shut down, which often appears as a hang.)  
 *
 * This interface is designed to be used together with 
 * <code>com.mathworks.toolbox.javabuilder.remoting.RemoteProxy</code> to automatically 
 * generate RMI server proxy objects for instances of 
 * LicensePlateLocation.LicensePlateLocation.

     *     %
     *     % Note: For those individuals who would prefer the rect with minimum

     *     % Thanks are also due to Roger for pointing out a proof that the
